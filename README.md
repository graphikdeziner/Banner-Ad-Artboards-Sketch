## Installation
Install this plugin via [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com) or download the package manually into to your Sketch3 Plugin Folder. The path should resemble the following
```.../com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/Banner Artboards Sketch``` **Note:** The .sketchplugin file needs to reside in a directory!

Afterwards, manually start an installation routine (once) within the Sketch App itself. Either goto the plugins menu and select Banner Artboards -> Install Social Artboards or use keyboard shortcut
```Alt + Crtl + I```. Afterwards you will find a new group called ```Banner``` whenever you select to create a new artboard (press the `A` key) in the right column of your App.

I would be endlessly editing artboards for these banner ads and you inspired me to help the office out. Give a shout out to the original creator of this plugin, I just modifed it for a specific use:
